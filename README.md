# MovingAverage
A program in the language J to calculate 10 day moving averages across 100 random numbers between 1 and 100. The program can be adjusted to calculate other moving averages across a smaller or larger amount of numbers. Although there might be faster or better solutions out there, I simply follow the definition of a 10 day moving average to solve the problem. I learnt a completely new language J within 2-3 days before solving this problem.
